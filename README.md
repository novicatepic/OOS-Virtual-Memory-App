# Operating System Course Project


This project focuses on various algorithms that enable users to interact with virtual memory. The implemented algorithms include FIFO, LRU, Second Chance, LFU, and the Optimal algorithm.

The application allows users to define the number of memory frames and the quantity of memory references. Following this, users input page numbers and select one or more algorithms, initiating the simulation process. The results, along with the number of page faults, are presented to the user. Page faults serve as a measure of the efficiency of each specific algorithm. A visual representation of the simulation can be found in the "OOS-PROJEKTNI.pdf" document.

The application has been developed using the Java programming language and is designed as a console-based program.

For the Serbian language specification, please refer to the "OOS-PROJEKTNI.pdf" document.
