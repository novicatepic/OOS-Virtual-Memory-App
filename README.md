# OOS-Project

This project is about different algorithms which allow the user to work with virtual memory. Algorithms which are implemented are FIFO, LRU, Second Chance, LFU and Optimal algorithm.
Applications allows user to specify number of memory frames and number of memory references.  After that, user inputs pages (numbers) and selects one or more algorithms and simulation starts. Results are shown to the user. Besides results, number of page faults are displayed to the user. Page faults represent efficiency of concrete algorithm. In OOS-PROJEKTNI.pdf there is a picture which shows how simulation should look.
Application is implemented in Java programming language.
If you want to check out specification in Serbian language, read OOS-PROJEKTNI.pdf.
